name: MeTube
description: MeTube is a web-based application that provides a user-friendly
  interface for the popular command-line tool, youtube-dl. It allows you to
  easily download videos from YouTube and dozens of other sites, right from your
  browser. The app supports playlist downloads, making it easy to grab an entire
  series of videos at once. It also offers a range of configuration options,
  allowing you to customize the download process to suit your needs. For
  instance, you can choose to save your downloads to a specific directory,
  separate audio-only downloads from video downloads, and even specify the
  filename template for your downloaded videos. MeTube also supports dark mode
  for a more comfortable viewing experience. The app runs in a Docker container,
  making it easy to deploy on any system that supports Docker.
