description: imgproxy is a powerful app designed to optimize images for web use,
  making websites and apps run faster while saving storage and SaaS costs. It
  works by resizing and processing images on the fly, eliminating the need for
  disk space and reducing the cost of conforming all saved images to specific
  formats. imgproxy offers a wide range of features for editing images,
  including resizing, cropping, contrast adjustment, pixelization, saturation,
  rotating, and more. It also provides security features to protect against
  common attack vectors in image processing. With imgproxy, you can upload
  images directly to the cloud or your cluster and request images by specifying
  parameters in the request URL. The app uses the worldâ€™s fastest image
  processing library, libvips, ensuring quick processing and a small memory
  footprint. imgproxy Pro plans offer advanced features and vary by capacity and
  types of support.
