name: n8n
description: n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool designed for technical
  people. It allows you to build complex automations 10x faster, without the
  need to fight with APIs. The app enables you to create flexible workflows
  focused on deep data integration. You can use JavaScript for complex tasks
  that require flexibility and the user-friendly UI for everything else. n8n
  provides the ability to connect APIs with no code for automating basic tasks,
  or write vanilla Javascript for manipulating complex data. It supports
  integration with any app and allows for the creation of custom scenarios at
  speed. With n8n, you can pump data around your entire tech stack with 350+
  native integrations or use custom code to create your own. It also offers
  features like bulk operations, painless debugging, and the ability to host on
  your own infrastructure. n8n is not just a helpful tool, it's the heart of
  your business, helping you optimize engineering resources, boost efficiency,
  and focus on your KPIs, not your APIs.
