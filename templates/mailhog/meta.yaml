name: Mailhog
description: MailHog is an intuitive email testing tool designed for developers.
  It allows you to configure your application to use MailHog for SMTP delivery,
  enabling you to view your outgoing emails in a user-friendly web UI. The app
  also offers the option to release messages to real SMTP servers for delivery.
  With MailHog, you can view messages in the web UI or retrieve them using the
  JSON API. It supports SMTP AUTH and PIPELINING, and provides real-time updates
  using EventSource. MailHog also includes a Chaos Monkey for failure testing
  and HTTP basic authentication for its UI and API. It's lightweight, portable,
  and requires no installation.
