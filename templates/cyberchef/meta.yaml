name: CyberChef
description: CyberChef, also known as the Cyber Swiss Army Knife, is a versatile
  web app designed to perform a wide array of 'cyber' operations within a web
  browser. It offers simple encoding methods like XOR and Base64, alongside more
  complex encryption techniques such as AES, DES, and Blowfish. CyberChef also
  provides tools for creating binary and hexdumps, compressing and decompressing
  data, calculating hashes and checksums, parsing IPv6 and X.509, changing
  character encodings, and much more. The app is designed to be user-friendly,
  enabling both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in
  complex ways without the need for intricate tools or algorithms. CyberChef is
  still under active development, with ongoing testing, bug fixing, new feature
  additions, and documentation improvements.
