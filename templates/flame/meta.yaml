name: Flame
description: Flame is a self-hosted startpage for your server, designed to be
  your very own application hub. Inspired by SUI, its sleek design is not only
  visually appealing but also incredibly easy to use. With Flame, you can
  create, update, and delete your applications and bookmarks directly from the
  app using built-in GUI editors. It also allows you to pin your favorite items
  to the homescreen for quick and easy access. The app features an integrated
  search bar with local filtering and 11 web search providers, and even gives
  you the ability to add your own. Flame also includes an authentication system
  to protect your settings, apps, and bookmarks. The interface is highly
  customizable, with dozens of options including support for custom CSS, 15
  built-in color themes, and a custom theme builder. Additionally, Flame
  features a weather widget with current temperature, cloud coverage, and
  animated weather status. It also integrates with Docker to automatically pick
  and add apps based on their labels.
